# 🚗 Insurance Purchase Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is focused on predicting whether a customer will purchase vehicle insurance based on various features such as age, gender, vehicle condition, annual premium, and more. The model helps in identifying potential customers who are more likely to buy insurance, aiding in targeted marketing.
